This script is designed to read package manager and system log files to determine
what software has been installed on the device by the user.  It does not print every
package name and dependency installed when attempting to install a software and
instead just lists the major package requested from the user.

=============================
	    NOTES
=============================
APT:
  Where apt is the defaul package manager, the script reads the apt logs under
  /var/logs/apt and sorts by user software requests that did not fail.

DNF:
  Where dnf is the default package manager, the script reads jourlanctl logs
  for software requests.  Dnf's logs were not accurate enough to do this properly.
  This seems to cause the issue that the script will only find software
  that has been installed before the last restart.
